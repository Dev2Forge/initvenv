Thank you for considering contributing to **InitVenv**! We welcome your help to improve our cross-platform automation tool for Python virtual environment management. Please follow these guidelines to help us maintain a high-quality project.

## How to Contribute

### 1. Reporting Issues
- Use the *GitHub Issues* tab to report bugs, request features, or ask questions.
- Please provide as much detail as possible, including:
  - Your operating system (Windows version, future Linux/macOS versions)
  - Python version installed
  - Steps to reproduce the issue
  - Expected vs. actual behavior
  - Screenshots if applicable

### 2. Suggesting Enhancements
- Open an issue and describe your idea.
- Explain how it benefits users of **InitVenv**.
- Consider cross-platform compatibility (Windows, Linux, macOS roadmap).
- Provide use cases and examples.

### 3. Submitting Pull Requests
- Fork the repository and create your branch from `main`.
- Follow the style and conventions used in the codebase (primarily *C#/.NET*).
- Write clear, concise commit messages.
- Test your changes thoroughly before submitting:
  - Test with different Python versions
  - Test with various `requirements.txt` configurations
  - Test both File Explorer and command-line usage methods
- Reference related issues in your PR description.
- Ensure your changes don't break existing functionality.

### 4. Coding Standards
- Use .NET compatible code following C# best practices.
- Follow established naming conventions and code structure.
- Add comprehensive error handling and validation.
- Include XML documentation comments for public methods and classes.
- Ensure cross-platform compatibility considerations for future releases.

### 5. Testing Guidelines
- Test the installer functionality:
  - PATH environment variable updates
  - Batch file generation and execution
  - Architecture-specific executable handling
- Test core functionality:
  - Virtual environment creation
  - Requirements installation from `requirements.txt`
  - Directory path handling (absolute and relative)
  - Error scenarios (missing Python, invalid paths, etc.)

### 6. Documentation
- Update README.md if your changes affect usage instructions.
- Document new features, command-line options, or configuration changes.
- Update release notes for significant changes.
