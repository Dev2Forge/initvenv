  <p>
    The project "Init Venv" (<a href="https://pypi.org/project/initvenv/" target="_blank">Init Venv - PyPI</a>) is now available! It currently includes three versions for Windows (Linux and macOS will follow soon). For now, the available builds are x86, x64, and arm64.  
    This project was written in C# ‚Äî I chose this language because of its ‚Äúcompatibility‚Äù with operating systems and because it‚Äôs the language of the creators of Windows (Microsoft). The project will soon have proper versions for Linux and Mac OS.
    Although the project was initially released two months ago, this ‚Äúnew‚Äù version is now hosted and distributed through Python‚Äôs package manager at <a href="https://pypi.org" target="_blank">PyPI</a>.  
    To check the installation commands, I recommend first reading a bit about what the project is about (links below):
