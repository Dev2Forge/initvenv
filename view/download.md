# Download

## Original Version (C# native version)
1. Download the latest [release](https://github.com/Dev2Forge/Init-Venv/releases)
2. Run the installer
3. The installer will:
   - Copy `InitVenv-{architecture}.exe` and `InitVenv.bat` to your chosen directory
   - Add the installation directory to system PATH

---


## This (`pip install`)

> Important: If you want the command to be available globally, you must install .__. in the global Python installation â€” that is, outside of virtual environments.

1. open a CMD and write
   ```shell
    pip install initvenv
   ```
2. Once installed, you can use it (As I said before, this version only allows calls from the console, not from Windows File Explorer)
