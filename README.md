**InitVenv** is a cross-platform automation tool that streamlines Python development workflow by automatically creating Python virtual environments, installing project dependencies from `requirements.txt`, and activating the environment with a single command execution. Currently supports Windows, with **Linux** and **macOS** support planned for future releases.

## Features

- **One-command setup**: Create Python virtual environment, install requirements, and activate with a single command
- **Windows integration**: Works seamlessly with Windows File Explorer
- **Automatic detection**: Finds and installs requirements from `requirements.txt` automatically
- **Path flexibility**: Supports both absolute and relative paths
- **Zero configuration**: Just run and go

## Requirements

- Python installed and added to system PATH
- Windows operating system (currently Windows-only)

## Installation

1. Download the latest [release](https://github.com/Dev2Forge/Init-Venv/releases)
2. Run the installer
3. The installer will:
   - Copy `InitVenv-{architecture}.exe` and `InitVenv.bat` to your chosen directory
   - Add the installation directory to system PATH

## Usage

### Method 1: Windows File Explorer (Recommended)

> If you want to have full compatibility, please consider installing the original executable version.

> Important: If you want the command to be available globally, you must install .__. in the global Python installation ‚Äî that is, outside of virtual environments.


### Method 2: Command Line

```bash
initvenv "C:\path\to\your\project"
```

You can use both absolute and relative paths:
```bash
# This
initvenv ".\my-project"
# Or
initvenv ".."
# or
initvenv "C:\path\to\folder\"
```

## How It Works

The installer creates a simple batch file that launches the main executable (Pass current path if you don't pass any):

```shell
@echo off
if "%~1"=="" (
  set "target=%CD%"
) else (
  set "target=%~1"
)

setlocal
"%~dp0initvenv.exe" "%target%"
endlocal
exit /b %ERRORLEVEL%
```

When you run `initvenv`, it:
1. Detects the current directory
2. Creates a Python virtual environment (`.venv`)
3. Activates the virtual environment
4. Installs packages from `requirements.txt` (if present)
5. Keeps the terminal open for continued work

## Important Notes

- The `requirements.txt` file must contain the dependencies **before** running InitVenv
- The program will not understand requirements once the virtual environment is created
- Currently supports Windows systems only

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome! Please feel free to submit a Pull Request. **I‚Äôd be glad to receive help writing the Linux and macOS versions, and adding compatibility with the Windows file system (in this PyPI version ‚Äî the original version already includes that compatibility).
